#This is a twitter bot called HOT GOSS

## Non Code Setup 
- Either create a twitter account or use one you are comfortable making into a bot.  
- You'll need to [sign up](https://apps.twitter.com/) to create a Twitter App
- Once you create the application, there are 4 important things to note down over at the “Keys and Access Tokens” tab:
* Consumer Key
* Consumer Secret
* Access Token Key
* Access Token Secret
